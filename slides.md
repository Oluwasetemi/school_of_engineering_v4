# Algorithms and FlowCharts

Definition: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. It is a sequence of instructions that are followed to achieve a desired outcome.

Example: An algorithm for making a cup of tea might include steps like boiling water, adding a tea bag to a cup, pouring the hot water into the cup, letting it steep for a few minutes, and then removing the tea bag.

---

# flowchart

Definition: A flowchart is a visual representation of the steps in a process or system using symbols, arrows, and text. It depicts the sequence of operations or steps, making it easier to understand how a process flows from start to finish.

Example: A flowchart for logging into a website might start with a "Start" symbol, followed by a decision symbol asking if the user has entered their username and password, arrows leading to "Enter username" and "Enter password" steps, and an end symbol once the login process is successful.

# Variables

Storage locations in memory with a name,
used to hold data.

```js {monaco-run} {autorun: false}
let name = 'AltSchool'
let age = 99

console.log({name, age})
```

```py
name = 'AltSchool'
age = 99

print(name, age)
```

---

# Data Types

Classification of data items, defining the operations that can be performed on them.

Primitive types: int, char, float, boolean, number, bigint, symbol, string, undefined, null,

Composite types: arrays, structs, classes.

Abstract data types: List, Stack, Queue, etc.

```js {monaco-run} {autorun: false}
let name = 'AltSchool'
let age = 99
let isStudent = true

const arrayOfScore = [99, 40, 50]
const person = { name: name, age: age, isStudent: isStudent }

console.log(arrayOfScore)
console.log(person)
```

---

# Control Structures

Direct the order of execution of statements in a program.

Conditional statements: if, else, switch.

Loops: for, while, do-while.

Branching: break, continue, return

````md magic-move
```js {*}
let name = 'AltSchool'
let age = 99

if (condition) {
  // do something
} else if (condition) {
  // do something else if
} else {
  // finally do something
}
```

```js
switch (key) {
  case value:
    // code
    break;

  default:
    break;
}
```

```js
for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
  const element = array[index];
}

while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}

```

# HTML
Semantic HTML, Heading & Sections, Attribute(Boolean, Enumerated, Global and custom attributes), Text Basics, Links, Navigation

---

# Understanding Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML is the practice of using HTML elements to structure your content based on their meaning and purpose, rather than their appearance. By using semantic markup, you provide context and meaning to the content, making it easier for both humans and machines (like search engines and assistive technologies) to understand the structure and purpose of the content.

---

# Meaning Over Appearance
This emphasizes that HTML elements should be chosen based on their semantic meaning, not their visual appearance. For example, don't use an &lt;h1&gt; element just because it renders text as large and bold by default; use it to represent the main heading or title of the content

---

#  Non-semantic vs. Semantic Markup


````md magic-move
### Non-semantic Markup

```html
<div>
  <span>Non-semantic Markup</span>
  <div>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
  </div>
</div>

```
In this example, the use of &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; elements provides no semantic meaning or context about the content structure.


```html
<header>
  <h1>Semantic Markup</h1>
  <nav>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
  </nav>
</header>
<main>
  <header>
    <h1>five words</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
    <h2>three words</h2>
    <p>forty-six words</p>
    <p>forty-four words</p>
  </section>
</main>
<footer>
  <p>five words</p>
</footer>
```


````


---

# Accessibility and Machine-Readability
This highlights how semantic markup improves accessibility and machine-readability. It shows examples of how browser developer tools display the Accessibility Object Model (AOM) differently for non-semantic and semantic markup. Assistive technologies like screen readers rely on the AOM to interpret the content structure and meaning correctly.

---

# Roles and Landmarks
This explains the concept of roles and landmarks in semantic HTML. Semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; have implicit roles that identify them as landmarks for assistive technologies. This helps users navigate the content more easily.

# Using the role attribute
While semantic elements have implicit roles, the content mentions that the role attribute can be used to assign a specific role to any element. However, it recommends using the appropriate semantic element instead of relying on the role attribute whenever possible.


```html
<div role="banner">
  <span role="heading" aria-level="1">Three words</span>
  <div role="navigation">
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
    <a>one word</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

---


# Choosing the Right Elements
This emphasizes the importance of choosing the right HTML elements based on their semantic meaning and functionality, not just their visual appearance. It encourages developers to ask themselves, "Which element best represents the function of this section of markup?" when writing HTML.
In summary, this stresses the significance of using semantic HTML for improved accessibility, machine-readability, and overall content structure and meaning. 


---

# Heading & Sections
- #### &lt;Header&gt;
 is used for introductory content at the top of a page, section, or article. This could include logos, titles, navigation menus, etc.

- #### &lt;nav&gt;
  is used to wrap major navigation blocks like menus.
- ### &lt;main&gt;
   represents the main content area of the page, unique to that specific page. There should only be one &lt;main&gt; per page.
- #### &lt;article&gt;
   is used for self-contained pieces of content that could be distributed or reused independently, like blog posts or news articles.
- ####  &lt;section&gt;
   is used to group related content together, like chapters or sections of a guide or tutorial.
- #### &lt;aside&gt;
   holds tangentially related content, like sidebars or inserts, that are separate from the main content flow.
- #### &lt;footer&gt;
  is used for footer content like copyright notices, contact information, or related links at the bottom of a page, section, or article.

---

# Attributes
- The type attribute on &lt;script&gt; and &lt;style&gt; elements specifies the type of content, like type="module" for ES6 modules or type="text/css" for CSS.
- The alt attribute on &lt;img&gt; elements provides alternative text for accessibility when the image can't be displayed. It's crucial for screen readers and other assistive technologies.
- aria-* attributes, like aria-label, aria-live, aria-hidden, etc., provide additional semantic information for screen readers and assistive technologies to help users better understand the content and its purpose.

---

# Text Basics
- &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; are used for headings, with &lt;h1&gt; being the highest level. There should only be one &lt;h1&gt; per page, with subsequent headings following a logical hierarchy (e.g., &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;,&lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;, etc.).
- &lt;p&gt; is used for regular paragraph text.
- &lt;blockquote&gt; is used for longer quoted text, often from another source. It can optionally contain a &lt;cite&gt; element for attributing the source.
- &lt;cite&gt; is used for citing the source of a quote, reference, or other creative work.
- HTML entities are special character codes that start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). They are used to display characters that are reserved in HTML, or that are not present on the keyboard.

# Link
- &lt;a href="url"&gt;Link Text&lt;/a&gt; is used for creating hyperlinks, with the href attribute specifying the URL or file path.
- The target attribute controls how the link is opened, like _self for the same window or _blank for a new window/tab.
- It's important to use descriptive link text that makes sense out of context, like "Read more about accessibility" instead of "Click here".

---

# Navigation
- &lt;nav&gt; is used to wrap major navigation blocks like menus, as mentioned earlier.
- &lt;ul&gt; is used for unordered lists, which are typically displayed with bullet points.
&lt;ol&gt; is used for ordered lists, which are typically displayed with numbers or other ordered indicators.
&lt;li&gt; is used for individual list items within &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;ol&gt; elements.
